# Light_adaption
R scripts for processing environmental light data, species determination from genome sequencing, analysis of growth rate, photosynthesis and pigment contents.

R scripts – 

1.	Seasonal light data bar charts, significance
2.	Coverage analysis.
3.	Correlations between seasonal light data/coverage and grouping light data.
4.	Extracting climate variables (Bioclim).
5.	Weather/temperature/climate analysis.
6.	Adegenet/PCA for species determination.  
7.	Growth analysis – RGR calculations, biomass, line plots.
8.	Photosynthesis analysis – parameter calculations, boxplots, difference calculations, NPQ and phi PS II light response curves.
9.	Chl car analysis, boxplots and difference calculations.
10.	Carotenoid profiling script, boxplots and statistics.
11.	Correlations and PCA for combined physiology.
    
Chl fluorescence scripts – 

12.	Fluorcam (PSI) chl fluorescence script for light response curve.
