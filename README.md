# Light_adaption
R scripts for processing environmental light data, species determination from genome sequencing, analysis of growth rate, photosynthesis and pigment contents.

R scripts – 
1.	Seasonal light data bar charts, significance? 
2.	Coverage analysis.
3.	Correlations between seasonal light data/coverage and grouping light data.
4.	Extracting climate variables (Bioclim).
5.	Weather/temperature/climate analysis.
6.	Adegenet/PCA for species determination.  
7.	Growth analysis – RGR calculations, biomass, line plots.
8.	Photosynthesis analysis – parameter calculations, boxplots, difference calculations.
9.	Chl car analysis, boxplots and difference calculations.
10.	Carotenoid profiling script, boxplots and statistics.
11.	Correlations and PCA for combined physiology.
    
Chl fluorescence scripts:
12.	Fluorcam (PSI) chl fluorescence script for light response curve.
